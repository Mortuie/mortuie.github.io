# First Post

## Introduction

I've wanted to write a blog for a very long time. I've tried and failed a couple of times, but I feel like 2023 might be the year where I start and post some facts/guides and random thoughts on tech and the world.

I am currently working as a software developer in London. I enjoy teaching and leveling up the people around me, but I'm also interested in how technology can solve people's problems and streamline obvious painpoints for everyone. At the core I believe this is the use of technology is the current world and I want to be apart of that.

## Goals of this Blog

I think one of my main weaknesses growing up was writing good english. I've obviously grown up in England, however my written communication in a professional setting has always not been so great. I also want to be able to spread my knowledge, learnings and mistakes throughout some of the professional and personal programming I complete.

I guess also one of the main benefits of having a blog is that it can be an automatic [accountability buddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_partner). So one of my next posts will outline the goals and learning objectives I have for the following year on a technical level. Once I learn a tool/thing and gain a relative mastery of it, I will outline some of the interesting things I have learnt from that experience right [here](https://blog.leonb.cc).

## Conclusion

So if you're interested check out the blog and let me know what you think!
