# Things to learn in 2023

## Programming Languages

- Broaden my knowledge and skills of frontend/backend TypeScript
- Learn a new programming language
  - Currently learning golang

## Frameworks

- NestJs
- A SSR framework for JS/TS (Remix/NextJS)
- Zustand (basic frontend statemanagement) would be cool to explore
- A HTTP Querying/caching solution (TanStack/query)
- A list virtualisation library (TanStack/virtual//table)

## Communication Layer

- A RPC framework based on protobufs (gRPC)

## Continuing

- Dive more deeply in REST API design
- GraphQL -> I'd like to build more with it and explore it further in real world scenarios
- JS/TS. I'd like to learn more about testing in fullstack javascript
  - Frontend Unit/Integration testing
  - Backend testing in nodejs
