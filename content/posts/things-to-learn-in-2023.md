# Things to learn in 2023

## Programming Languages

- Broaden my knowledge and skills of frontend/backend TypeScript
- Learn a new programming language
  - Currently learning golang. See my progress on [my github.](https://www.github.com/mortuie)
  - Maybe tinker with some RUST - This is a hardcore stretch goal?

## Backend

- A new TS backend framework: NestJs
- Another RPC framework. Mostly looking at gRPC & protobufs

## Frontend

- A SSR framework for TS (Remix/NextJS). Leaning towards NextJS
- Expand my knowledge on Zustand (basic frontend statemanagement). Looks really cool for simple stuff.
- A HTTP Querying/caching solution (TanStack/query)
- A list virtualisation library (TanStack/virtual//table)

## Continuing & Expanding

- Dive more deeply in REST API design
- GraphQL -> I'd like to build more with it and explore it further in real world scenarios
- TS I'd like to learn more about testing in a fullstack TS stack
  - Frontend Unit/Integration testing
  - Backend testing in nodejs
    - mocking/integration testing/smoke testing

## Conclusion

Whilst I'm going through my list I want to write up some blog posts about my learnings and pain points. I also want
to write about some of the pros and cons and demo each technology. Not only that I can learn and improve my writing
skills but so that other people can learn from it too.
